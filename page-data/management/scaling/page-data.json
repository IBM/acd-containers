If the capacity is exceeded, the system will start to queue up requests to protect the container processes from overload. If the queues fill up, the system will return errors to the caller indicating the system is not available.\n\nTo adjust the workload capacity, ACD deployment instances can be horizontally scaled by adjusting the replica count in the `Acd` custom resource instance.\n\n**Note:** Ensure you have enough capacity on the worker nodes in the cluster to support the number of replicas chosen. Each replica consumes approximately 64 GB of memory across all of the deployment pods and there needs to be room for non-disruptive rolling updates.\n\nTo update the replica count using the web console, do the following:\n\n1.
