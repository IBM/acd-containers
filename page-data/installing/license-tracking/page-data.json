License usage is based on a Virtual Processing Core (VPC) metric. For ACD, it is the top-level pod `merative-acd-acd` that will be metered for VPC usage.  The usage will be the capacity of the node where this pod runs. For example, ACD running in a cluster with 16 CPU/node has license usage = 16 VPC. The ACD CPU limit can be adjusted by the number of replicas configured and the size of the nodes where ACD runs.
