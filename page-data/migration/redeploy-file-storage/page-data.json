Follow your usual backup process, or run this command as an example of a direct command to do the backup (`exec` in, tar to shared file system, and then copy out.)\n\n  Replace `<backup_file_name>` with the name you want to use as your backup file name.\n\n  ```\n  export source_acd_pod_name=$(oc get pods -n ${source_acd_namespace} | grep acd-acd | awk '{print $1}')\n  oc exec ${source_acd_pod_name} -n ${source_acd_namespace} -- tar -I \"gzip --best\" -cf - /opt/ibm/watsonhealth/services/config/artifactstore/tenant_data > <backup_file_name>.tar.gz\n  ```\n\n1. Create the target ACD namespace and switch to that namespace as your project.\n\n  Replace `<target_ACD_namespace>` with the name you want to use as your new ACD namespace.\n\n  ```\n  export target_acd_namespace=<target_ACD_namespace>\n  oc create namespace ${target_acd_namespace}\n  oc project ${target_acd_namespace}\n  ```\n\n1. Create a new PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) and PersistentVolume (PV) in the target namespace. Create a PVC using the OpenShift console, or save the example yaml below as <target_pvc_name>.yaml. Replace `<target_pvc_name>` with the new PVC name. Ensure the rest of the configuration matches that of your existing PVC in the source ACD namespace. It should show a status of `Bound`.\n\n  ```\n  apiVersion: v1\n  kind: PersistentVolumeClaim\n  metadata:\n    name: <target_pvc_name>\n    spec:\n    accessModes:\n    - ReadWriteMany\n    resources:\n      requests:\n        storage: 10Gi\n    storageClassName: ocs-storagecluster-cephfs\n    volumeMode: Filesystem\n  ```\n\n  ```\n  export target_pvc_name=<target_pvc_name>\n  oc create -f <target_pvc_name>.yaml -n ${target_acd_namespace}\n  oc get pvc -n ${target_acd_namespace}\n  ```\n\n1. Create a new ACD instance in the target namespace using the target PVC name.\n\n  Also bring forward the rest of your configured settings from the existing source deployment, such as tenant header, license usage, etc.\n\n  Refer to [Installing ACD](/installing/installing/) for installation steps.\n\n1. Verify all ACD pods start up as expected.\n\n  ```\n  oc get pods -n ${target_acd_namespace}\n  ```\n\n1. Redeploy your cartridges to the new ACD instance so they are persisted to the new storage volume.\n\n  - See [Deploying and updating the ACD-provided cartridges](/usage/getting-started/#deploying-and-updating-the-acd-provided-cartridges) for deploying the provided cartridges.\n  - See [Cartridge deployment](/usage/customizing/#cartridge-deployment) for deploying your custom cartridges.\n\n1. Make OAuth proxy updates for secure access to the target namespace, if configured to use this.\n\n  For ACD deployments (not the Configuration Editor), create a serviceview role in target namespace and grant all service accounts in the proxy namespace access to it. Follow the steps 7 and 8 under [Manage Access](/security/manage-access/).\n\n  Update the proxy deployment upstream option to point to the ACD service (or cartridge service) in the target namespace. Follow step 2 under [Manage Access](/security/manage-access/).\n\n1.
