References to target ACD or target namespace are referring to a new Merative ACD instance and namespace.\n\n1. Save the source ACD namespace name.\n\n  Replace `<existing_ACD_namespace>` with your existing ACD namespace.\n\n  ```\n  export source_acd_namespace=<existing_ACD_namespace>\n  ```\n\n1. Gather and save the source ACD configuration for persistent storage, tenant header, etc. These will be used when creating the target ACD instance and input through the OpenShift console during the install step.\n\n  `s3_bucket`=\n\n  `s3_endpointUrl`=\n\n  `s3_location`=\n\n  `tenantHeader`=\n\n1. Create the target ACD namespace and switch to that namespace as your project.\n\n  Replace `<target_ACD_namespace>` with the name you want to use as your new ACD namespace.\n\n  ```\n  export target_acd_namespace=<target_ACD_namespace>\n  oc create namespace ${target_acd_namespace}\n  oc project ${target_acd_namespace}\n  ```\n\n1. Create the secret for the object storage bucket in the target namespace. Replace `<cos_id>` with your S3 bucket access key ID and `<cos_secret>` with your S3 bucket access key secret.\n\n  ```\n  echo ‘<cos_id>’ | tr -d ‘\\n’ > username\n  echo ‘<cos_secret>’ | tr -d ‘\\n’ > password\n  oc create secret generic merative-acd-as --namespace ${target_acd_namespace} --from-file=username --from-file=password\n  ```\n\n1. Take a backup of the persistent storage in the source namespace. Follow your usual backup process.\n\n1. Create a new ACD instance in the target namespace using the existing persistent storage configuration.\n\n  Also bring forward the rest of your configured settings from the existing source deployment, such as tenant header, license usage, etc.\n\n  Refer to [Installing ACD](/installing/installing/) for installation steps.\n\n1. Verify all ACD pods start up as expected in the target namespace.\n\n  ```\n  oc get pods -n ${target_acd_namespace}\n  ```\n\n1. Make OAuth proxy updates for secure access to the target namespace, if configured to use this.\n\n  For ACD deployments (not the Configuration Editor), create a serviceview role in target namespace and grant all service accounts in the proxy namespace access to it. Follow the steps 7 and 8 under [Manage Access](/security/manage-access/).\n\n  Update the proxy deployment upstream option to point to the ACD service (or cartridge service) in the target namespace. Follow step 2 under [Manage Access](/security/manage-access/).\n\n1. Uninstall the source ACD instance and source ACD operator at a later date.\n\n  Refer to [Uninstalling ACD](https://merative.github.io/acd-containers/installing/uninstalling/) for instructions.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"3813b1bbd91346055b2c97077a914cdd","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":247},"frontmatter":{"title":"Migration of Existing Object Storage","excerpt":"Migration of Existing Object Storage.","categories":"migration","slug":"migrate-object-storage","toc":true},"excerpt":"Migration of Existing Object Storage.","exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: \"Migration of Existing Object Storage\"\nexcerpt: \"Migration of Existing Object Storage.\"\ncategories: migration\nslug: migrate-object-storage\ntoc: true\n---\n\nThe Merative Annotator for Clinical Data Container Edition is the replacement for the IBM Watson Annotator for Clinical Data Container Edition.
