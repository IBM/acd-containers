This problem would result in ACD returning a 500 exception.\n- Fixed an exception in the Negation Detection service that could occur if a negation annotation was created without a trigger and a negation filter attempted to filter based on trigger information. This problem would result in ACD returning a 500 exception.\n- Improved the internal processing of ACD when a micro-service is unavailable. This should result in fewer ACD 500 exceptions. \n- Added support for propagating embedded custom values in a derived concept value.\n- Added support for propagating medical codes for derived concept values.\n- Added support for deriving a custom value.\n- Added support to allow the covered text or preferred name of a selected concept in a derived concept to populate a field on the output annotation.\n- Added support for matching an attribute over a derived concept value backed by an ACI Medication or ACI Lab Value annotation.\n- Added support to find secondary annotations in a derived concept value from the derived from trail (not by matching CUIs).\n- Added support to allow matching CUI from the derived concept value.\n- Added support to propagate fields from the derived concept value first and use the secondary annotation as a fallback option.\n- Added support to promote dimension, frequency, and duration to the attribute if they exist in a derived concept value annotation.\n- Added warning messages when a processed ACD flow contains deprecated services.\n- Updated the documentation to reflect the new Merative ACD product branding.\n\n## January 2023\n\n- Fixed a problem in how filters were processed by the Negation and Hypothetical Detection services.  In a multi-threaded environment this could result in an exception or filters not being processed correctly.\n- Added support for UMLS 2022AA. UMLS 2019AA has been removed and 2020AA is now deprecated (will be removed in 2023 when we add support for UMLS 2023AA).\n- Added support to control whether the Hypothetical service uses internal triggers.\n- Added support for the ACD debug flag in the ACD Python SDK.\n- The prometheus metric names and label names for the ACD service have been changed to remove IBM from the names. The ACD metric names are documented [here.](https://merative.github.io/acd-containers/troubleshooting/logging-monitoring/#acd-metrics)\n\n## October 2022\n\n- Added support for defining groups of concept dictionaries for a cartridge that should participate together during longest span processing.\n- Speed improvements to the clinical insight models.\n- Improvements to the adverse drug event detection models.\n- Added support for Clinical Associations, linking associated diagnoses, procedures, and sites in clinical text.\n\n## June 2022\n\n- Concept detection, medication, procedure, and symptom disease annotators now support medical code mappings. A Medical Code mapping represents a mapping of a UMLS Concept Identifier (CUI) to a medical code. This mapping provides the medical code for a term identified within the unstructured text.\n- Added support for greedy temporal linking in the temporal models.\n- Added support to symptom disease, procedure, cancer, and allergy annotators to output the complete set of medical codes that concept detection supports.\n\n## February 2022\n\n- Improved medication adverse event model with associatedAdverseEvent modifier links.\n\n## November 2021\n\n- Initial release of substance use models for clinical insights.\n\n## October 2021\n\n- Added support for UMLS 2021AA. UMLS 2018AA has been removed and 2019AA is now deprecated (will be removed in 2022 when we add support for UMLS 2022AA).\n\n## August 2021\n\n- Added support for disambiguation filters.\n\n## June 2021\n\n- Annotator for Clinical Data Service container edition GA.\n- Added relative date support to the temporal models.\n\n## May 2021\n\n- Added support for custom fields in concept dictionaries.\n\n## March 2021\n\n- Allow custom dictionaries to be enabled for expanded concept detection.\n\n## February 2021\n\n- Added support for vocabulary customization in the spell check service.\n\n## November 2020\n\n- Initial release of temporal models.\n\n## August 2020\n\n- Initial release of normality models for clinical insights.\n\n## July 2020\n\n- Added support for UMLS 2020AA. UMLS 2017AA has been removed and 2018AA is now deprecated _(will be removed in 2021 when we add support for UMLS 2021AA)._\n\n## April 2020\n\n- Initial release of clinical insight models for Diagnosis, Medication, and Procedure\n\n## October 2019\n\n- Asynchronous (non-blocking) cartridge deployment APIs with persisted deployment status.\n\n## September 2019\n\n- Added ability to apply spelling corrections from the spell check annotator for use by all service annotators.\n\n## August 2019\n\n- Added support for UMLS 2019AA. UMLS 2016AB has been truncated and UMLS 2017AA is now deprecated _(will be removed in 2020 when we add support for UMLS 2020AA)._\n\n## June 2019\n\n- When spelling corrections from the spell check annotator are present, the concept detection annotator will leverage those spelling corrections for entity detection.\n- The IBM Watson Annotator for Clinical Data Service is now available in the IBM Cloud US South location for approved internal IBM solution providers.\n- Support for attribute detection over derived concepts with longest span.\n\n## Service API versioning\n\nAPI requests require a version parameter that takes the date in the format version=YYYY-MM-DD. Send the version parameter with every API request.\n\nWhen we change the API in a backwards-incompatible way, we release a new minor version. To take advantage of the changes in a new version, change the value of the version parameter to the new date. If you're not ready to update to that version, don't change your version date.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"00b9d45d862a06e5796fc51391e8f9c8","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":213},"frontmatter":{"title":"Release notes","excerpt":".","categories":"Help","slug":"release-notes","toc":true},"excerpt":".","exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: \"Release notes\"\nexcerpt: \".\"\ncategories: Help\nslug: release-notes\ntoc: true\n---\n<!--                                                                    -->\n<!-- (C) Copyright Merative US L.P. and others 2019, 2023               -->\n<!--                                                                    -->\n<!-- SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0                                -->\n<!--                                                                    -->\n\n\n<!-- # Release notes -->\n\nThe following sections document the new features and changes that were included for each release of the Annotator for Clinical Data service.\n\n## April 2023\n\n- Fixed an exception in the Concept Detection service that could occur in concept inferencing processing when the text does not contain punctuation.
