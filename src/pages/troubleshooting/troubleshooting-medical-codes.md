## Missing Medical Codes

Medical codes are supported as of the 2019AA version of the UMLS library. Ensure you are using the 2019AA or higher version of UMLS. For the [concept detection](/clouddocs/annotator_concept_detection/) and [attribute detection](/clouddocs/annotator_attribute_detection/) annotators, ensure you have specified the optional configuration parameter to return the medical codes in your flow definition.
