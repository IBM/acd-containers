## High availability considerations

IBMÂ® Watson Annotator for Clinical Data Container Edition default deployment model disributes replicas across nodes and can also span zones with a region.
Disruption in the network connectivity may happen within a regiong.  Recovering from potential disasters that affect an entire region requires planning and preparation.
Instance owners should develop recomvery plans based on their use cases.

### Availability during updates and voluntary operations

Pod disruption budgets can be configured such that a minimum number of replicas are available during voluntary operations like upgrades or other cluster administration activities.
The [management](../../management/pod-disruption) section provides an example that was tested with the default deployment Annotator for Clinical Data Container Edition.

### Disaster recovery

Disaster recovery can become a necessity is a region experiences a significant failure that includes the potential loss to data.
Recovery can be accomplished by deploying into multiple regions or installing in a new region is an existing instance becomes unavailable.
See [Backup and Recovery](../../management/backup-and-recovery) for more information on data recovery.
